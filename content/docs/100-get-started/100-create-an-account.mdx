The Raydiant Developer Platform is in private beta, if you are interested in building an app get in touch at [raydiant.com/developers](https://www.raydiant.com/developers/) or talk to your account administrator.

A developer account will give you access to both the Raydiant Dashboard and the Developer Portal.

## Raydiant Dashboard

The [Raydiant Dashboard](https://dash.raydiant.com) is where you can create playlists of content and publish them to your devices.

When you build a Raydiant app it will be available in the Dashboard, allowing you to test your app’s inputs, how it behaves in a playlist and publish it to a device.

## Developer Portal

The [Developer Portal](https://developers.raydiant.com) is where you can create and manage your Raydiant apps and API keys for the [On-Brand Menu API](/docs/on-brand-menu-api).

You can also submit your app to the [Marketplace](/docs/marketplace) through the Developer Portal to share it with thousands of other Raydiant users.
