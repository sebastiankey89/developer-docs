## What screen resolutions should my app support?

All Raydiant apps must support 1080p, 720p in both portrait and landscape orientations. For the best responsive results, consider making your app scale to any 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio.

## How do I track my appâ€™s users?

Raydiant does not currently provide any analytics for your app. In the meantime we recommend using your preferred web analytics service such as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

## What browser is used on the device?

Our devices currently run Chromium 85.0.4183.84.

## How do I get a device?

If you are building a Raydiant and do have have access to a device reach out to [product@raydiant.com](mailto:product@raydiant.com).
