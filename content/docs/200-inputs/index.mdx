excerpt: Customize your app in the Raydiant Dashboard.

Inputs allow users to customize your app in the Raydiant Dashboard, for example:

- Set the location for a Weather app with the _text_ input.
- Select a channel for a Newsfeed app with the _select_ input.
- Enable a QR code for a Custom Menu app with the _toggle_ input.

The URL template of your app receives the values of its inputs by specifying where to inject them using the syntax `:input-id`:

```bash
https://my-weather-app.com?location=:location
https://my-news-app.com/:channel
https://my-menus-app.com/juices?qrcode=:qrcode
```

When users customize your app in the Raydiant Dashboard the input values are injected into the URL template to render the resulting URL:

```bash
https://my-weather-app.com?location=New York
https://my-news-app.com/politics
https://my-menus-app.com/juices?qrcode=true
```

Raydiant supports a variety of input types you can use to customize your app. Check out the [Build an App](/docs/get-started/build-an-app) tutorial for an in-depth walkthrough on how to add inputs.
