excerpt: How to submit your app the Raydiant Marketplace

To make your available in the Raydiant Marketplace, email [product@raydiant.com](mailto:product@raydiant.com) to submit your app for review and we’ll be in touch.

Once your app is approved you will see “Live in the Marketplace” next to your app in the Developer Portal.

## New Versions

Marketplace apps must also submit new versions for review before they are made available to all Raydiant users.

You can test unapproved versions of your app from the [Raydiant Dashboard](https://dash.raydiant.com) when creating a new presentation for your app and selecting the unapproved version.

You can re-submit your app at any time if you wish to make changes. Click “Change version” in the Developer Portal and select the version you’d like to submit for review.

Once your new app version has been approved you can set the active version by clicking “Set version”.
